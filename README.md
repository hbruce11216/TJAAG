# TJAAG
<b>January 2021 Fellows Research &amp; Data Project for TJAAG</b>
<br><br>
I will be focused on modeling the relationship between geography, wealth, and admissions.

Create charts showing:
- avg wealth of an MS [I think that means middle school] median income over time
- TJ admittances by middle school over time (highlight)
- Relationship between draw district median income and TJ admittees; for AAP centers make sure to also compare their regular district vs AAP draw area;
- time-series chloropleths showing the change in the geographic distribution of wealth and TJ admittees over time

Datasets they gave:
- FCAG applicant/semifinalist/admitted data by school over; census data on median income by census tract or zip code over time 
- FFXco GIS data for boundaries and zip codes
- GIS tools:
  - https://www.qgis.org/en/site/, 
  - https://app.datawrapper.de/create/map 

Other notes on the subject:
- Project Summary:  Examining the correlation (or lack thereof) between the geographic shift in wealth throughout the county and the shift in TJ feeder schools over time

Data sets necessary: 
- TJ admissions by middle school over time
Wealth by zipcode, over time
- FCPS middle school boundaries (ideally over time, not necessarily)
- ZIP code boundaries
- List of GT/AAP center schools over time (ideal but not necessary)

Deliverables:
- Descriptive analysis of wealth of a middle schoolâ€™s draw district and # of admittees to TJ
- Series of choropleths showing the geographic distributions of wealth and TJ admits over time in Fairfax county
- Sankey diagrams disaggregated by middle schools for applied, semi, admitted

Timeline:
- To frame this since it has the sharpest timeline: I'll be checking with the executive board on when the secretary of education wants us to have this done, but a rough timeline I was thinking for an informal release is as follows:
- Familiarization of data, lit review, ideas for analyses: due 1/3/2020
- Analyses + basic visualizations: due 1/17/2020
- Report for review by E-board and more: due 1/22/2020

I recognize that it's a pretty short timeline (especially for the report) but there are 4 of you so I think it's very doable to generate a comprehensive report and compelling set of analyses; the short turnaround from analysis should report should also specifically encourage focusing on a concise, digestible deliverable -- as much as I love analyses, they'll go over the heads of most legislators and policymakers.  Focus on the takeaways, impacts, and consequences... but we'll cross that bridge when we get there
